There shall be a close relationship between some variables in a dataset.
Close relationships among some variables should be investigated both for imputation and training machine learning methods. 
To this end, this repository presents a methodology and an implementation. Please give feedback if you correct and contribute anything.

In this repository, we delve into the following topics:
## 1. Data and Data PreProcessing
## 2. Investigating The Dependency Between Variables
### 2.1 - Numerical Values vs Numerical variables - Correlation
### 2.2 - Categorical vs Categorical variables - Chi-Square test of independence
### 2.3 - Categorical vs Numerical Variables - ANOVA-KRUSKAL WALLIS tests
